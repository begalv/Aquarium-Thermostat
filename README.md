# Aquarium Thermostat Project

The project consists on the physical and logical elaboration of a fish tank temperature controller. It is possible, through buttons for user input and a LCD display for output, to choose the aquarium's ideal temperature, which will be determined by a fan cooler and an aquarium heater, controlled by an arduino.

There are three temperature states for the aquarium: Cold, in which the heater turns on and the LED blinks blue; Ideal, in which the arduino only monitors the temperature and the LED blinks green; Medium-hot, in which the cooler works at half power and the LED blinks yellow; and Hot in which the cooler works at its maximum power and the LED blinks red.

The project aims to assist scientific research involving the control of temperature in aquariums for the extraction of fish data. These data are used for agriculture, such as aquaponics, and several other areas of knowledge.
