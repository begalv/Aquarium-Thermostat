# Aquarium Thermostat Project

The project consists on the physical and logical elaboration of a temperature controller in a fish tank. It will be possible, through buttons for user input and a LCD display for the output, to choose the aquarium's ideal temperature, which will be determined by a fan cooler and an aquarium heater, controlled by an arduino.

There will be three temperature states for the aquarium: Cold, in which the heater will turn on and the LED will blink blue; Ideal, in which the arduino only monitors the temperature and the LED will blink green; Medium-hot, in which the cooler will work at half power and the LED will blink yellow; and Hot in which the cooler will work at its maximum power and the LED will blink red.

The project aims to assist scientific research involving the control of temperature in aquariums for the extraction of fish data. These data are used for agriculture, such as aquaponics, and several other areas of knowledge.

**obs: This project was developed by a first-semester student of computer science**
